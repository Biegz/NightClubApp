# CSE248BieglerSweeneyRinaldi
NightClub Project for CSE 248

Here lies the continuation of the master branch. My-ark-branch was created on April 25th, 2017, in order to save our code from an all out flood. The nightclub project will live on, thanks to developers Austin Biegler, Niko Rinaldi, and Dylan Sweeney. The proper history of commits of the master branch are not completely accurate towards the end of its life... but the master branch lives on to cast a shadow of what once was. My-ark-branch contains the refined version of our current work. Thank you.
